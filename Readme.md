EVM Wallet Generator & Batch Transfer Project
Overview

This project provides a set of Node.js scripts to automate two common tasks in EVM blockchain development:

    Wallet Generation: Create a large number of EVM-compatible wallets and securely save their credentials.

    Batch Funding: Distribute a small amount of ETH from a primary "funder" wallet to all the newly created wallets.

This is particularly useful for airdrops, setting up test accounts, or distributing funds for a decentralized application.
Features

    Generate Wallets: Creates any number of wallets and exports their addresses and private keys to a wallets.csv file.

    Batch Transfers: Reads addresses from the CSV and sends a pre-configured amount of ETH to each one sequentially.

    Secure: Uses a .env file to keep your private keys and RPC URLs out of the source code.

    Configurable: Easily change the number of wallets, the amount to send, and the network configuration.

    Robust: Includes error handling for file access and insufficient funds.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (version 14.x or later)

    npm (usually comes with Node.js)

üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
1. Clone or Download the Project

First, get the project files into a folder on your computer.
2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory with your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary libraries (ethers.js and dotenv):

npm install

3. Create the Environment File (.env)

This is a critical step for security. Create a new file named .env in the root of your project folder. This file will store your sensitive information.

Copy the following into your .env file and replace the placeholder values:

# Your main wallet's private key (must have funds for transactions)
# WARNING: For testing, use a key from a testnet wallet, NOT your mainnet wallet.
MAIN_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."

# An RPC URL for the network you want to use (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli, or Mainnet)
# You can get a free one from services like Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode.
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"

Important: The .env file should never be committed to a public repository like GitHub.

# EVM Wallet Generator & Batch Transfer Project

## Overview

This project provides a set of Node.js scripts to automate two common tasks in EVM blockchain development:
1.  **Wallet Generation**: Create a large number of EVM-compatible wallets and securely save their credentials.
2.  **Batch Funding**: Distribute a small amount of ETH from a primary "funder" wallet to all the newly created wallets.

This is particularly useful for airdrops, setting up test accounts, or distributing funds for a decentralized application.

    EVM Wallet Generator & Batch Transfer Project

    This project contains two main scripts:
    1. generateWallets.js: Creates N number of EVM wallets and saves them to wallets.csv.
    2. batchTransfer.js: Reads addresses from wallets.csv and sends a small amount of ETH
       to each from a main funding account.

================================================================================

    --- ðŸš¨ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ðŸš¨ ---

    1. INITIALIZE YOUR PROJECT:
       - Create a new folder for your project.
       - Open a terminal in that folder and run the following commands:
         npm init -y
         npm install ethers dotenv

    2. CREATE THE SCRIPT FILES:
       - Create a file named `generateWallets.js` and copy the first script below into it.
       - Create a file named `batchTransfer.js` and copy the second script below into it.

    3. CREATE THE .env FILE:
       - In the same folder, create a file named `.env`
       - This file will store your secret keys securely. Add the following lines to it,
         replacing the placeholder values with your actual data:

         # Your main wallet's private key (must have funds for transactions)
         # IMPORTANT: Make sure this is a testnet wallet for testing!
         MAIN_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."

         # An RPC URL for the network you want to use (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli, or Mainnet)
         # You can get one for free from services like Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode.
         SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"


    4. RUN THE SCRIPTS:
       - First, run the wallet generator:
         node generateWallets.js

       - After it creates the wallets.csv file, run the transfer script:
         node batchTransfer.js
